I've been to Tokyo again. But this time, it's a business trip.

**LINE DEV DAY 2019** is a public event which was held at Grand Nikko Daiba Hotel, Tokyo on November 2019.
This two days event was started on 20th and welcomed hundreds of developers from many companies around the world.

Each days will start with a keynote presentation by a LINE head branch manager. I was really enjoying these presentation and honestly they are best presentations of the event.
There also many sessions speaking about different topics which is main concerns of LINE developers, including Server Side stuffs, Infrastructure, Securities. And for me as a frontend developer, sessions about UI/UX and UIT always had my attentions.

For anyone caring about those presentations, you can have a look at theirs [speaker deck page](https://speakerdeck.com/line_devday2019). Some of presentations are not available from here, and most of them are talks from the guests.

#### Not to waste this chance, AGAIN

It's not common for me to visit Japan, and for us too. So I took some steps and went around Tokyo.
Unluckily they were very cold and wet days. But it is not enough to stop me.

Just wanna show the world another nice picture that I took. Really loved this one.

Have you ever googled "am lich" just to know what day is today in _Vietnamese lunar calendar_? Now it could be easier and friendlier with **amlich.rs** right in your terminal ;).

### amlich.rs

It was really into Rust and then I went and seeked for an idea that help me practicing it. And then I came up with the idea of building a CLI tool that help me lookup what day it is in Vietnamese Lunar calendar.
I started diging on internet _how to calculate lunar calendar date from gregorian date_.

> Oops. It wasn't easy as I thought :O

There were thousands of new terms that kicked my brain and I was, really really confused. Things like about sun and moon, and it cycles, et cetera... Oh well, I was gonna give it up.
I meant I gave up "Learning it on my own". Instead I found some interesting articles, and luckily they came with some JS implementation. So my job now is only converting them into Rust. Yay!

#### For those who concerned
The calculation method that I found is [here](https://www.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/~duc/amlich/calrules.html). Shout out for Mr. Ho Ngoc Duc because of his very detailed instruction on the calculation method. Also there is an [English version](https://www.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/~duc/amlich/calrules_en.html) for those don't speak Vietnamese.

#### Source code and binaries

You can find them in [this github repository](https://github.com/ngobach/amlich.rs).

### My first Rust project

A boring monday I walked around Reddit, and I see a guy asking about how better is **Rust** in comparison with Golang. Well that day I was just into Golang and fell in love with it (I still love Golang today). In comment section, people talk a lot about Rust performance over Golang, yet also its complexity. I decide that I must give Rust a try.

What is Rust and how good is it? I questioned myself and head straight to its homepage.

First impression of Rust was really kicking. My brain was about to shutdown. But I was excited too, especially heard about its pros. And then I take hours to learn it.
Until today I still not really know it but who know, maybe I will work with Rust one day and I know I am locked and loaded.

### And more

I also wrote a game with Rust and GGEZ game engine: **ggez-2048**. Gonna talk about it later!
